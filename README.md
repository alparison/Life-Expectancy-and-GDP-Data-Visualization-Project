Python Data Visualization Project 

In this project, I imported a dataset from the World Health Organization that contained information on six countries, specifically their expected life-span and GDP over a period of fifteen years (2000-2015).  This was project was primarly focused on data visualation and interpretation.  The visualizations and corresponding code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file, while the interpretation file is titled "Conclusions".  

This project utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create visualizations which aided in the rapid interpretation of data.
